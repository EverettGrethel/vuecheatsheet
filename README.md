To make a new Vue app, run
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
This should also initialize a .git file. You can add a remote repo with
```
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
```
along with pushing a first commit.<br>
To run the dev server, run
```
npm run serve
```
You could also run "npm run lint", which will check for any linting errors.
To add Vue Router or other CLI plugins, run
```
vue add router
```
We could have also added router initially by using a custom preset instead of default.
